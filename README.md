# Animalese Typing for Visual Studio Code!!
=====================================
Fork of https://github.com/boykensoidong/Typing-Sounds and assets from https://github.com/joshxviii/animalese-typing/tree/chrome
Immediately works out of the box with no setup required.
You can adjust the volume by messing with the Typing Sounds: Volume Up/Down commands.
Pretty darn simple and made by Sky.Bit :D
