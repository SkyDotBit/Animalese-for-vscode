# Animalese Typing for Visual Studio Code!!

<p>Fork of https://github.com/boykensoidong/Typing-Sounds and assets from https://github.com/joshxviii/animalese-typing/tree/chrome</p>
<p>Immediately works out of the box with no setup required.</p>
<p>You can adjust the volume by messing with the Typing Sounds: Volume Up/Down commands.</p>
<p>Pretty darn simple and made by Sky.Bit :D</p>
